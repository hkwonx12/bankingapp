The team worked on completing the Code of Conduct. We came up with ideas for the module 3 project.
We will work on a Bank App that simulates real-life banking with pseudo money.
We came up with MVP for the project.

We created the wire-frame today on excalidraw. This helped us to flesh out what we want the app to look like,
and what kind of components/features we want to create.


# March 22, 2023
We cleaned up the wire-frame today and began the api design.


# March 23, 2023
We finished up the wireframe today and added more details to the features. We cleared up what kind of data we want to work with today.
We planned for a rough timeline of how we want to work on the project.

We decided as a group to use SQL as our database. We will continue to research throughout the weekend and come together to begin coding on Monday.

We have tried to complete our docker-compose.yaml file, requirements.txt, and begin authentication today. We are planning to work as much as we can and if we run into any issues, we will listen to the lecture tomorrow.


# March 28, 2023
We began our authentication today. We tried to set a goal to finish majority of authentication today but realized that it is a bigger portion of the project that we need to spend time on. We have set an 'end-of-the-week' goal to finish authentication.


# March 29, 2023
We wrote our code for creating authentication account today. We also fixed our Database Url login. Everytime we change the docker-compose.yml, we have to delete our volume and rebuild. We got rid of the external db and wrote in the yml to create every time we compose up.


# March 30, 2023
I could not contribute to the progress today as I had to step out of bootcamp. The team figured out how to create and get a user using the authenticator. They created notes on the bugs and solutions to keep me updated. We will continue with deleting the token, updating a user, etc. on Monday.


# April 3, 2023
Today we continued to debugg the user authentication and git issues. We broke up the backend to different components and created issues on gitlab for them.
