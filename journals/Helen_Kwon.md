We have tried to complete our docker-compose.yaml file, requirements.txt, and begin authentication today. We are planning to work as much as we can and if we run into any issues, we will listen to the lecture tomorrow.

We began our authentication today. We tried to set a goal to finish majority of authentication today but realized that it is a bigger portion of the project that we need to spend time on. We have set an 'end-of-the-week' goal to finish authentication.
